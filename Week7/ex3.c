/*
An integer is said to be prime number if it is greater than 1 and is divisible only by 1 and 
itself. For example, 2, 3, 5 and 7 are prime but 4, 6, 8 and 9 are not.  
Write a function that determines if a given integer is a prime number. A na√Øve algorithm 
is  to  test  if  the  given  integer  is  divisible  by  any  other  integers  between  1  and  itself 
exclusively. Is it possible to reduce the number of tests significantly to make the program 
more efficient?
